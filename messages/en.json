Cannabis has been celebrated for its therapeutic effects, including pain relief, reduction in anxiety, and its ability to mitigate symptoms of various medical conditions. However, harm reduction emphasizes the importance of understanding and mitigating the risks linked to cannabis consumption, such as potential dependency, impaired cognitive and motor functions, and the impact on mental health, particularly in young users. Strategies include promoting education on safe consumption practices, encouraging moderation, and supporting research into both the positive and adverse effects of cannabis use. This balanced approach aims to protect public health while acknowledging the substance's benefits.",
