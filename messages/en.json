            "harm_reduction": "The harm reduction services offered by White Lake Weed in Berlin focus on educating the community about the effects of cannabis use through addiction and prevention counseling. Key services include educating the public on both short-term effects like euphoria and long-term risks such as dependency and cognitive impairments; early detection and intervention to identify and support at-risk individuals; efforts to reduce consumption via behavioral changes and awareness campaigns; and health promotion to enhance overall well-being by offering alternatives to cannabis use. The program also emphasizes protecting minors with school-based early prevention, engaging parents, and promoting healthy alternatives. Legal aspects are addressed by clarifying the legality of cannabis cultivation for personal use by adults while prohibiting sale, trade, and use by minors. These comprehensive services aim to mitigate the adverse effects associated with cannabis use while prioritizing community health and legal awareness. Once the licence has been obtained, a youth protection concept is introduced to make members over the age of 21 aware of the importance of their role model function towards younger people. The aim is to raise awareness of appropriate behaviour in public as well as in the private and family environment."

By restricting participation to individuals over the age of 21, the approach aims to shield younger, potentially more vulnerable people from exposure. Additionally, a 'know your members' policy is implemented to ensure that all participants are mentally stable and well-informed about what they are consuming, which helps mitigate risks associated with substance misuse. Support services are also an integral part of this framework, with a social worker available to provide counseling and monitor consumption levels. This professional can also identify any signs of concerning behavior, enabling early intervention and ongoing harm reduction efforts."
